Vehicle Fleet
=============

Demo system for RentMe fleet of connected rental trucks. Each truck in
our fleet sends us telemetry data updates, including location, heading
and various internal indicators, including whether of not a service is
required. The user can browse all the vehicle locations via a zoomable
map with an inset containing all the vehicle details. Vehicles that
need a service are shown in orange or red depending on the urgency of
the repairs. Service stations can be shown on the map by selecting a
menu item.
